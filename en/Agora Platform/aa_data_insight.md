# Data Insight (Beta)
The **Data Insight** function of Agora Analytics provides periodic call usage and call quality statistics. It is designed to help you understand the trend of the usage and quality of your calls, their distribution in various dimensions, and daily data breakdown.

The **Data Insight** function does the following:

- Shows daily statistics within a specified date range. 
- Updates the statistics every day.

<div class="alert info"><b>Data Insight</b> covers only the usage and quality statistics of the Agora RTC SDK.</div>

## Key terms

This section describes the key terms used in **Data Insight**. See [Agora Key Terms](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms) for more key terms.

### Channel

Every call or ineractive streaming happens in a channel. If we imagine an app being a building, a channel will be a room in the building.

**Data Insight** does not count a channel by name, but by lifecycle. It counts each time from when the first users joins the channel to when the last user leaves it.

### User

Each user in the channel has a unique [user ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#a-nameusernameausername). 

**Data Insight** counts a unique username in a unique channel as one user. If a real-life user joins one channel with different usernames, or joins different channels with one username, **Data Insight** counts the user in both situations as multiple users.

### Usage

Usage counts the user's actual duration in the channel.

Video usage is the duration of received video after a user joins a channel; audio usage is the duration of video not received after a user joins a channel. 

### Outlier

An outlier is a value that differs significantly from other values.

Data Insight marks outliers in red numbers on the Top panel under **Quality Overview**, to indicate the dates when some issues might have occurred.
