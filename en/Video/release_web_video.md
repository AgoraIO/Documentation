# Release Notes
This page provides the release notes for the Agora Web SDK.

## Overview

The Agora Web SDK is a JavaScript library loaded by an HTML web page. The Agora Web SDK library uses APIs in the web browser to establish connections and control the communication and live interactive streaming services. For the key features included in each scenario, see [Voice Call Overview](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/product_voice?platform=All%20Platforms), [Video Call Overview](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/product_video?platform=All%20Platforms),  [Live Interactive Audio Streaming Overview](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/product_live_audio?platform=All%20Platforms), and [Live Interactive Video Streaming Overview](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/product_live?platform=All%20Platforms).

### Compatibility

For the web browser support of the Agora Web SDK, see [Which browsers does the Agora Web SDK support?](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/browser_support)

<div class="alert note">To ensure better end user experience, Agora highly recommends using the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">latest version</a> of Google Chrome on desktop.</div>
<div class="alert info">To enable interoperability between the Agora Native SDK and Agora Web SDK, use the Agora Native SDK v1.12 or later.</div>

### Known issues and limitations

- Due to web browser autoplay policy changes, the `Stream.play`, `Stream.startAudioMixing`, and `Stream.getAudioLevel` methods need to be triggered by the user's gesture on Chrome 70 or later and on Safari. See [Autoplay Policy Changes](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes).
- The Agora Web SDK supports video profiles of up to 1080p resolutions if the client has a true HD camera installed. However, the maximum resolution is limited by camera device capabilities.
- On some iOS devices, when you switch the Safari browser to the background and back during a call, black bars might appear around your video.
- The Agora Web SDK does not support code obfuscation.

For more issues, see [Web FAQs](https://docs.agora.io/en/search?type=faq&platform=Web).

## v3.2.3
v3.2.3 was released on October 28, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:

- After `setLiveTranscoding` was called, pushing streams to CDN failed if `startLiveStreaming` was called before the SDK triggers the `Client.on("liveTranscodingUpdated")` event.
- After `stopLiveStreaming` was called, the SDK failed to trigger the `Client.on("liveStreamingStopped")` event.

## v3.2.1
v3.2.1 was released on September 11, 2020. This version fixed the error in compiling and packaging after some users upgraded to v3.2.0.

## v3.2.0
v3.2.0 was released on September 7, 2020.

**New features**

#### Video transmission optimization strategy

v3.2.0 adds the `optimizationMode` property in the `StreamSpec` interface. When creating a stream object by calling `createStream`, you can choose between the following two optimization strategies to ensure the quality of video images meets the end users' requirement under poor network conditions:

- `"detail"`: Prioritizes clarity. In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the sending resolution, but may reduce the frame rate.
- `"motion"`: Prioritizes smoothness. In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the frame rate, but may reduce the sending resolution.

If you leave this property empty, the SDK uses the default transmission optimization strategy:

- For a screen-sharing video stream (setting the `screen` property as `true` when calling `createStream`), the default transmission optimization strategy is to prioritizes clarity.
- For the other types of video streams, the SDK may reduce the frame rate or the sending resolution in poor network conditions.

**Improvements**

v3.2.0 fully supports Chromium-based versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 80 and later).

**Fixed issues**

- Memory leak caused by the audio mixing function.
- Occasional black screens.
- The audio sending bitrate was too high after the audio profile was set by `setAudioProfile`.
- The method call of `Stream.init` failed when the device does not support the capture frame rate of 15 fps.

**API changes**

v3.2.0 adds the [`optimizationMode`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.streamspec.html#optimizationmode) property in `StreamSpec`.

## v3.1.2

v3.1.2 was released on August 11, 2020.

**New features**

#### Regional connection

This release adds the `areaCode` property in `ClientConfig` for specifying the region for the connection when creating a `Client` object. After specifying the region, the SDK connects to the Agora servers within that region.

You can choose from the following regions:

- China
- North America
- Europe
- Asia, excluding Mainland China
- Japan
- India
- Global

This advanced feature applies to scenarios that have regional restrictions.

**Fixed issues**

The value of the `success` parameter in the `Client.on("stream-reconnect-end")` callback was inaccurate.

**API changes**

Adds the [`areaCode`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.clientconfig.html#areacode) property in `ClientConfig`.

## v3.1.1

v3.1.1 was released on June 1, 2020.

**Improvements**

From this release, the RTMP converter supports the Agora cloud proxy service.

**Fixed issues**

- Occasional reconnection errors.
- Failure to destroy the player after the user unsubscribes from a remote stream.
- The SDK failed to trigger the callback when the local user called `getLocalVideoStats` within three seconds after publishing a stream.

## v3.1.0

v3.1.0 was released on April 30, 2020.

**Behavior changes**

v3.1.0 optimizes [dual-stream mode](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms#dual-stream) and makes the following changes in SDK behavior:

- The low-quality stream has a fixed default video profile: A resolution (width × height) of 160 × 120, a bitrate of 50 Kbps, and a frame rate of 15 fps.
- The low-quality video stream keeps the aspect ratio of the high-quality video stream. If you set the resolution of the low-quality stream to a different aspect ratio, the SDK automatically adjusts the height of the low-quality stream so that the aspect ratio remains the same.

**New features**

<!--#### 1. Media metadata

Adds `Client.sendMetadata` to support attaching media metadata to a published stream. You can use this feature to broaden the types of interactions in a live streaming channel, such as sharing digital coupons and online quizzes.

Adds the `Client.on("receive-metadata")` callback to notify the app when the SDK receives metadata from a remote user.

<div class="alert note">Note:
	<li>This feature supports the H.264 codec only.</li>
	<li>When the network is unstable, the SDK cannot guarantee strict synchronization between the metadata and the media stream.</li>
</div>-->

#### Event of unpublishing a stream

Adds the `Client.on("stream-unpublished")` callback. When the local user successfully unpublishes a stream, the SDK triggers this callback.

#### Multiple TURN servers

This release enables you to pass configurations of multiple TURN servers to `ClientConfig.turnServer.`

**Fixed issues**

- Occasional reconnection failure.
- Video streams published from iOS Safari rotated by 90 degrees on the receiving clients.
- On Firefox 75, calling `Stream.getStats` got an empty result.
- In audio-only scenarios, calling `Stream.switchDevice` caused errors.
- If reconnection occurred when calling `Client.join`, the SDK did not return the user ID after joining the channel successfully.
- The value of the `status` property in `StreamPlayError` was inaccurate.
- Occasionally, the SDK triggered the `Client.on("mute-audio")` and `Client.on("mute-video")` callbacks repeatedly.
- The SDK failed to get the local audio when creating streams in Electron.

**API changes**

Added the event `"stream-unpublished"` in [`Client.on`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.client.html#on).

## v3.0.2

v3.0.2 was released on March 16, 2020. This version made some internal improvements.

## v3.0.1

v3.0.1 was released on February 12, 2020.

**New features**

#### Dual-stream mode support for custom video source streams

This version supports the dual-stream mode (`enableDualStream`) for video streams created by defining the `videoSource` property.

**Improvements**

Optimizes the reconnection strategy to improve the user experience under poor network conditions.

**Fixed issues**

- A repeated call of `setClientRole` causes errors.
- The console prints error messages after calling `Client.leave` when the network is disconnected.
- An error occurs when creating a stream with the `videoSource` property.
- The `muteAudio` and `muteVideo` methods do not take effect after unsubscribing from and then subscribing to a remote stream.

##  v3.0.0

v3.0.0 was released on December 2, 2019.

This release optimizes the SDK's performance in terms of transmission quality and interoperability, significantly reducing the time to render the first remote video frame, and improving the video experience under poor downlink network conditions.

**New features**


#### Channel media stream relay

Adds the following methods for relaying the media stream of a host from a source channel to a destination channel. This feature applies to scenarios where hosts from different live streaming channels interact with each other.

- `startChannelMediaRelay`
- `updateChannelMediaRelay`
- `stopChannelMediaRelay`

During a media stream relay, the SDK reports the states and events of the relay with the `Client.on("channel-media-relay-state")` and `Client.on("channel-media-relay-event")` callbacks.

For more information on the implementation, API call sequence, sample code, and considerations, see [Co-host across Channels](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/media_relay_android?platform=Web).

#### Audio sharing

Adds the `screenAudio` property to `StreamSpec` for sharing the local audio playback when sharing a screen. See [Share audio](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/screensharing_web?platform=Web#a-name--screenaudioashare-audio) for details.

#### Image enhancement

Adds the `setBeautyEffectOptions `method for setting image contrast, brightness, sharpness, and red saturation. See [Image enhancement](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/image_enhancement_web?platform=Web) for details.

#### Adding watermark images to a live stream

Adds the `images` property to `LiveTranscoding` for inserting online PNG images as watermarks to a live streaming.

#### Encryption/decryption failure notification

Adds the `Client.on("crypt-error")` callback for notifying the app that an encryption/decryption failure occurs when the local users is publishing or subscribing to a stream.

**Improvements**

#### Reporting the state of a remote video stream

Adds the `Client.on("enable-local-video")` and `Client.on("disable-local-video") `callbacks for notifying the app that a remote user on the Native SDK calls `enableLocalVideo` to enable or disable video capture.

#### Reporting the reason why a remote user goes offline

Adds `reason` to the `Client.on("peer-leave")` callback for reporting the reason why the remote user goes offline.

**Fixed issues**

- `Client.join` does not report the error of an incorrect App ID in its onFailure callback function.

- Occasionally, the SDK does not automatically reconnect after being disconnected from the servers for pushing and pulling streams.

## v2.9.0
v2.9.0 is released on September 5, 2019.

**Compatibility changes**

To improve the usability of the RTMP streaming service, v2.9.0 defines the following parameter limits in [`LiveTranscoding`:](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.livetranscoding.html)

- `videoFramerate`: Frame rate (fps) of the CDN live output video stream.  Agora adjusts all values over 30 to 30.
- `videoBitrate`: Bitrate (Kbps) of the CDN live output video stream. Set this parameter according to the [Video Bitrate Table](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/interfaces/agorartc.videoencoderconfiguration.html#bitrate). If you set a bitrate beyond the proper range, the SDK automatically adapts it to a value within the range.
- `videoCodecProfile`: The video codec profile. Set it as 66, 77, or 100. If you set this parameter to other values, Agora adjusts it to the default value of 100.
- `width` and `height`: Pixel dimensions of the video. The minimum value of width x height is 16 x 16.

**New features**

#### Support for NAT64

Supports using the Agora Web SDK in NAT64 networks.

#### Using the front or rear camera

Adds the `facingMode` parameter in the `createStream` method to set using the front or rear camera on mobile devices.

#### Unbinding events

Adds the `Client.off` method to support removing the events attached by the `Client.on()` method.

**Improvements**

- Reduces the number of required firewall ports. Users with firewalls do not need to open UDP ports 10000 to 65535. See [Web SDK firewall ports](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/firewall?platform=All%20Platforms#web-sdk).
- Further improves the NAT type compatibility and the media stream connection.
- Shortens the time to join the channel and the time to render the first remote video frame.
- Optimizes the experience in poor downlink network conditions.
- Specifies error messages in the failure callback function of some API methods.
- Syncs the mute status every time a stream is successfully published.
- Only triggers the volume-indicator after joining a channel.
- Optimizes the verification of parameters.

**Issues fixed**

- The subscribing options are reset after reconnection.
- Calling `Stream.close` when initializing the stream causes abnormal behaviors.
- Setting `cacheResource` in `Stream.startAudioMixing` does not take effect.
- Abnormal behaviors after network disconnection.

**API changes**

- Adds the `Client.off` method.
- Adds the `facingMode` parameter in`AgoraRTC.createStream`.

## v2.8.0
v2.8.0 is released on July 8, 2019.

This version optimizes the support for string UIDs.

All users in the same channel should have the same type (number or string) of user ID. If you use string UIDs to interoperate with the Agora Native SDK, ensure that the Native SDK uses the string user account to join the channel. See [Use String User Accounts](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/string) for details.

## v2.7.1

v2.7.1 is released on July 3, 2019. 

**Issues fixed**

Setting the video profile of the shared screen by the `Stream.setScreenProfile` method does not take effect.

## v2.7.0

v2.7.0 is released on June 21, 2019.

**New features**

#### 1. Customizing the video encoder configuration

Adds the `Stream.setVideoEncoderConfiguration` method to customize the video encoder configuration. Compared with the`Stream.setVideoProfile` method, this method is more flexible and supports customizing the video resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. See [Set the Video Profile](../../en/Video/video_profile_web.md) for details.

#### 2. Reporting the status of the stream playback

For easier management of the stream playback status, v2.7.0 adds the following functions:

- Adds the `callback` parameter in the `Stream.play` method to report the result of playing a stream. If the playback fails, this parameter provides the error details.
- Adds the `"player-status-change"` callback in `Stream.on`. When the stream playback status changes, this callback is triggered to report the playback status and the reason why the status changes.
- Adds the `Stream.resume` method to resume the playback when the `Stream.play` method fails.

#### 3. Reporting when the first remote audio/video frame is decoded

Adds the `"first-audio-frame-decode"` and `"first-video-frame-decode"` callbacks in `Client.on`  to notify the app when the first remote audio/video is decoded after subscribing to the remote stream.

#### 4. Reporting changes to the media device

Adds the `"audioTrackEnded"` and `"videoTrackEnded"` callbacks in `Stream.on` to notify the app when the audio/video track no longer provides data to the stream, for example when the device is removed or deauthorized.

#### 5. Supporting Microsoft Edge

Supports audio calls, video calls, and live interactive streaming on the Microsoft Edge browser. For details, see [Agora Web SDK FAQ](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/browser_support#edge).

**Improvement**

This version allows updating the video encoder configuration dynamically. You can call `setVideoProfile` or `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` before or after `Stream.init`.

> Do not set the video encoder configuration when publishing a stream.

**Issues fixed**

- Some of the statistics returned by calling `Stream.getStats` are incorrect.
- Calling `Client.leave` does not take effect when the network connection is lost.
- Some of the statistics on the call quality are incorrect when String UIDs are used.
- The return value of `Stream.getAudioMixingPosition` is inaccurate when the audio mixing file is playing.

- Adds the `Stream.setAudioVolume` method, which sets the audio volume of the subscribed stream.
- Adds the `networkTypeChanged` callback to inform the app on network type changes.
- Adde the `streamTypeChanged` callback to inform the app on stream type changes (from a low-stream video to a high-stream video or vice versa).
- Supports both string and number types for the `uid` parameter in the `Client.join` method.
- Supports 360 Secure Browser 9.1.0.432 and later.
- Supports Chrome 49 on Windows XP.

**Issues fixed**

- The dependency on the video codec in audio-only calls when a user joins a channel from Safari or Chrome on mobile devices.
- A failure to receive the `stream-removed` callback 10 seconds after another user calls the `Stream.close` method to stop streaming from the Safari browser.
- A warning after a user uses the same UID to reset the `Stream.userID` method.

## v2.4.1

v2.4.1 is released on September 19, 2018. 

**Issues fixed**

- The local publisher may not automatically publish after an IP address change, so the remote subscriber cannot receive the video stream.
- Unsubscribing from the remote stream triggers the `stream-removed` callback.

## v2.4.0

v2.4.0 is released on August 24, 2018. 

**New features**

#### 1. Support for Token Authentication

See [Security Keys](../../en/Agora%20Platform/token.md) for details.

#### 2. Support for Audio Processing

Adds the support for AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) and ANS (Automatic Noise Suppression) in the `audioProcessing` property. 

#### 3. Support for Audio/Video Pre-processing

Adds the `audioSource` and `videoSource` properties in the `client.createStream` method, which specifies the audio and video tracks. Therefore, you can process the audio/video before creating a stream. 

#### 4. Support for Setting the Audio Profile

Adds the `stream.setAudioProfile` method, which provides various audio profile options (the sample rate, mono or stereo, and the encoding rate).  

#### 5. Support for Setting the Stream Fallback

Adds the <code>client.setStreamFallbackOption</code> method, which allows the receiver to automatically subscribe to the low-stream video or the audio-only stream under poor network conditions.

#### 6. Adds Delay-related Statistics

Adds delay-related statistics in the `stream.getStats` callback, including the delays from the publisher to the SD-RTN, from the SD-RTN to the subscriber, from end to end, and from sending to playing audio/video. 

#### 7. Support for Log Upload

Adds the `AgoraRTC.Logger.enableLogUplaod` method, which supports uploading the SDK’s log to Agora’s server. 

**Issues fixed**

- The `cameraId` and `microphoneId` settings do not take effect unless the `stream.setVideoProfile` method is called.
- Calling the `setScreenProfile` method does not take effect on the Firefox browser.
- An error occurs if both audio and the screen are enabled in the `client.createStream` method.
- The `microphoneId` setting does not take effect in screen sharing.
- The `audioProcessing` settings do not take effect.
- The `stream.play` method can be called repeatedly without calling the `stream.stop` method.

## v2.3.1

v2.3.1 is released on June 7, 2018. 

**Issues fixed**

- Occasional publishing failures on web browsers that installed the Adblock Plus extension.
- Invalid IP jumps.

## v2.3.0

v2.3.0 is released on June 4, 2018.

**New features**

#### 1. New Session Mode

To increase the application scenarios and improve interoperability with the Agora Native SDK, the `mode` and `codec` properties are added in the `createClient` method, in which `mode` includes `rtc` and `live`, while `codec` includes `vp8` and `h264`. 

#### 2. Support for Audio Gain Control

To meet customers’ needs for audio control during a communication or live interactive streaming session, the `audioProcessing` property is added in the `createStream` method.

#### 3. Support for Proxy on the Web Side

To enable enterprises with a company firewall to access Agora’s services, the `setProxyServer` and `setTurnServer` methods are added. By calling these methods, you can bypass the firewall and send the signaling messages and media data directly to the Agora SD-RTN through the servers. You need to deploy the Nginx and TURN servers before calling these methods before joining the channel.

#### 4. Support for Encryption

Encryption is supported to enhance security for communications or live streaming. Users need to set the encryption mode and password before joining a channel to use this function. 

**Issues fixed**

In the case of p2plost, the SDK stops reconnecting to the server after one or several reconnections.

## v2.2

v2.2 is released on April 16, 2018. 

**New features**

#### 1. Gets the version information.

Supports getting the version of the current Web SDK. 

#### 2. Sets the low-stream parameter.

Adds the `setLowStreamParameter` method to set the low-stream parameter. 

#### 3. Supports screen-sharing for the Firefox browser.

Adds the support for the Firefox browser to share the screen by adding the <code>mediaSource</code> property in the <code>createStream</code> method. See [Screen Sharing on Firefox](../../en/Video/screensharing_web.md) for details.

#### 4. Supports the QQ browser.

Adds the support for the QQ browser.

**Issues fixed**

No voice in the voice-only mode when an iOS device joins a session using the Safari browser.
