# Release Notes
  ## Overview

The Agora Real-time Messaging (RTM) SDK provides a streamlined and stable messaging mechanism for you to quickly implement real-time messaging for various scenarios. See [product overview](../../en/Real-time-Messaging/product_rtm.md) for more information.


## v1.4.1

v1.4.1 was released on November 5, 2020.

**New features**

Fixed the performance issue when communicating with the RTM Native SDK.

## v1.4.0

v1.4.0 was released on September 25, 2020.


**New features**

Geofencing. You can use the `areaCodes` parameter in `createInstance` to set the region of the Agora RTM SDK. The RTM SDK can only connect to Agora RTM servers within the specified region.


**API changes**

#### Added

The `areaCodes` parameter is added to  [`createInstance`](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/modules/agorartm.html#createinstance).


## v1.3.1

v1.3.1 was released on August 7, 2020.

**Fixed issues**

- Connection stability issue between the Agora RTM SDK and the Agora RTM system.
- The same offline message might be delivered multiple times.
- Login stability issue of the RTM SDK.
- Stability issue of sending and receiving peer-to-peer messages. 
- The [`TokenExpired`](https://docs.agora.io/cn/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/interfaces/rtmevents.rtmclientevents.html#tokenexpired) callback could not be triggered in time.


## v1.3.0

v1.3.0 was released on June 16, 2020.

**Compatibility changes**

- The Agora server blocks any file message or image message that you send to RTM SDK 1.2.2 or earlier, or to the Signaling SDK.
- The typical timeout for asynchronously calling a method changes from 5 seconds to 10 seconds.

**New features**

#### 1. Send and receive file messages or image messages

You can call `createMediaMessageByUploading` to upload non-empty files or image files no greater than 30 MB. Each uploaded file or image stays in the Agora server for seven days. The SDK returns a media ID as the unique identifier of the file or image file. You can use the `RtmFileMessage` interface or the `RtmImageMessage` interface to save the media ID. The `RtmFileMessage` interface and the `RtmImageMessage` interface are type aliases of the `RtmMessage` interface, so you can send and receive file or image messages via peer-to-peer or channel message methods. You can call `downloadMedia` to download the received file or image file.

#### 2. Manage upload or download tasks

You can use the `mediaTransferHandler` interface to cancel or report the progress of an upload or download task.

**Fixed issues**

Fixed the login issues for some users.

**API changes**

## v1.2.2

v1.2.2 was released on February 21, 2020.

**Compatibility Changes**


| Timeout | Before v1.2.2 | v1.2.2 |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Send a channel message.     | 5 s    | 10 s     |



**Issues fixed**

The SDK occasionally returns `LOGIN_ERR_UNKNOWN` when logging in from a recent version of Chrome on a Windows platform. 

## v1.2.1

v1.2.1 was released on December 17, 2019.  

**New Feature**

*Compatible with the endCall method of the Agora Signaling SDK*

If you use the `sendMessageToPeer` method to send a <i>text</i> message in the format of AgoraRTMLegacyEndcallCompatibleMessagePrefix\_\<channelId\>\_\<your additional information\>, then this method is compatible with the endCall method of the legacy Agora Signaling SDK. Replace \<channelId\> with the channel ID from which you want to leave (end call), and replace \<your additional information\> with any additional information. Note that you must not put any "_" (underscore) in your additional information but you can set \<your additional information\> as empty "".

**Issues Fixed**


- If a channel member reconnects to the Agora RTM server after being interrupted, chances are the rest members of the channel can receive `MemberJoined` twice. 

## v1.2.0 

v1.2.0 was released on November 15, 2019. 

**New Features**

#### Subscribe to the online status of the specified user(s)

When the method call succeeds, the SDK returns the PeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report the online status of peers, to whom you subscribe.
When the online status of the peers, to whom you subscribe, changes, the SDK returns the PeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report whose online status has changed.
If the online status of the peers, to whom you subscribe, changes when the SDK is reconnecting to the server, the SDK returns the PeersOnlineStatusChanged callback to report whose online status has changed when successfully reconnecting to the server.

#### Unsubscribe from the online status of the specified user(s)

Allows you to unsubscribe from the online status of the specified user(s).

#### Get a list of the peers, to whose specific status you have subscribed

Allows you to get a list of the peers, to whose specific status you have subscribed.

#### Create a raw message

Creates and initializes a raw message to be sent.

 If you set a text description, ensure that the size of the raw message and the description combined does not exceed 32 KB.
 
**Issues fixed**
 
The SDK is occasionally kicked by the server: When the issue occurs, the Client instance receives the `ConnectionStateChange` callback, which indicates the connection state is `ABORTED` and the reason for the connection state change `INTERRUPTED`. The log file shows the error code from the server is 10001. 
 

## v1.1.0

v1.1.0 was released on September 18, 2019. It adds the following features: 

- [Gets the member count of specified channel(s).](#getcount)
- [Automatically returns the latest numer of members in the current channel](#oncount)
- [Channel attribute operations](#channelattributes)



**Compatibility Changes**

1. The [getServerReceivedTs](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_java/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_message.html#a7994de6da26269c3137e93ddf7a2c2be) method of the [RtmMessage](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_java/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_message.html) object supports both peer-to-peer and channel messages. 
2. Timeout for sending a peer-to-peer message is 10 seconds from this release, compared to 5 seconds in previous versions. See [PEER_MESSAGE_ERR_TIMEOUT ](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_java/interfaceio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_status_code_1_1_peer_message_error.html#a9aaaa5b9fa46cc15327abd6c2825bc4d).

**New Features**

<a name="getcount"></a>
#### 1. Gets the member count of specified channel(s).

You can now get the member count of specified channel(s) without the need to join, by calling the `getChannelMemberCount` method. You can get the member counts of a maximum of 32 channels in one method call. 

<a name="oncount"></a>
#### 2. Automatically returns the latest numer of members in the current channel 

If you are already in a channel, you do not have to call the `getChannelMemberCount` method to get the member count of the current channel. We also do not recommend using `onMemberJoined` and `onMemberLeft` to keep track of the member counts. As of this release, the SDK returns to the channel members `MemberCountUpdated` the latest channel member count when the number of channel members changes. Note that:

- When the number of channel members â‰¤ 512, the SDK returns this callback when the number changes and at a MAXIMUM speed of once per second.
- When the number of channel members exceeds 512, the SDK returns this callback when the number changes and at a MAXIMUM speed of once every three seconds.

<a name="channelattributes"></a>
#### 3. Channel attribute operations

Supports setting or getting the attribute(s) of a specified channel. You can use this feature to create group anouncement.

Each channel attribute comes as a key-value pair. See [RtmChannelAttribute](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_java/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_channel_attribute.html) for more information. Where: 

- The key of each channel attribute must be visible characters and not exceed 8 KB.
- Each channel attribute must not exceed 8 KB in length. 
- The overall size of the attributes of a channel must not exceed 32 KB. 
- The number of attributes of a channel must not exceed 32. 

Specific features: 

- Sets the attributes of a specified channel with new ones.
- Adds or updates the attribute(s) of a specified channel.
- Deletes the attributes of a specified channel by attribute keys.
- Clears all attributes of a specified channel.
- Gets all attributes of a specified channel.
- Gets the attributes of a specified channel by attribute keys.

When updating attributes of a channel, you can use the  `enableNotificationToChannelMembers` flag to decide whether or not to notify all members of the channel about this attribute change.  

**Improvements**

#### Resends peer-to-peer messages

This release improves the resending mechanism of peer-to-peer messages, and extends the timeout for sending a peer-to-peer message from five to 10 seconds, greatly improving the success rate of peer-to-peer message sending under weak network conditions. 

#### Caches channel messages

The Agora RTM system will resend a maximum of 32 channel messages of up to 30 seconds to channel members, when they manage to reconnect to the system from poor network conditions. This greatly improves the overall arrival rate of channel messages under weak network conditions.

> - To intercommunicate with the legacy Agora Signaling SDK, you MUST set the channel ID. However, even if the callee successfully accepts the call invitation, the Agora RTM SDK does not join the channel of the specified channel ID.
> - If your App does not involve the legacy Agora Signaling SDK, we recommend using the `LocalInvitation.content` or the `RemoteInvitation.response` property to set customized contents. 


#### Sets the output log level of the SDK

Supports setting the output log level of the SDK using the `logFilter` parameter.  The log level follows the sequence of OFF, ERROR, WARNING, and INFO. Choose a level to see the logs preceding that level. If, for example, you set the log level to WARNING, you see the logs within levels ERROR and WARNING. 


### API Changes

#### Adds
