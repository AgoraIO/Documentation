# User and Channel Events RESTful API

<div class="alert note">For the user events and channel events RESTful API, the number of requests per second for each App ID must not exceed 10.</div>

## <a name="auth"></a>Authentication

The Real-time Messaging RESTful API only supports HTTPS. You can use either of the following methods to authenticate your HTTP request: 

- [Basic authentication](#basicauth)
- [Token authentication](#tokenauth)

### <a name="basicauth"></a>Basic authentication

You need to pass the basic HTTP authentication and put `api_key:api_secret` in the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header. For more information on how to generate the `Authorization` filed, see [RESTful API authentication](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/restful_authentication).

### <a name="tokenauth"></a>Token authentication

If you have already generated an RTM Token on your server, you can use token authentication. You need to put the following information to the `x-agora-token` field `x-agora-uid` field when sending your HTTP request: 

- The RTM Token generated at your server. 
- The uid you use to generate the RTM Token. 

**Sample code**

The following sample code shows how to implement token authentication in Java:

```java
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
  ...
  // Puts your RTM Token to the `x-agora-token` field of the HTTP request. 
  .addHeader("x-agora-token", "<Your RTM Token>")
  // Puts the uid, which generates the RTM token, to the `x-agora-uid` field of the HTTP request.
  .addHeader("x-agora-uid", "<Your uid used to generate the RTM Token>")
  ...
```

> For more information about how to generate an RTM Token, see [Token Security](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/rtm_token?platform=All%20Platforms).


## API sequence


- Get user events: Call the [Gets user events API](#get_user).
- Get channel events: Call the [Gets channel events API](#get_channel).


## Data format

All requests are sent to the host: `api.agora.io`.

- Request: See the examples in the following APIs.
- Response: The response content is in JSON format.
- Base URL: `https://api.agora.io/dev/v2/project/<appid>`

<div class="alert note"><code>&lt;appid&gt;</code> is the <a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/rtm_token?platform=All%20Platforms&_ga=2.227392984.415089684.1594611574-73063204.1585890674#a-name--appidause-an-app-id-for-authentication">App ID</a> used by your project. All the request URLs and request bodies are case-sensitive.</div>


## <a name="get_user"></a>Gets user events (GET)

This method gets the user events from the address specified by the Agora RTM server. Events you acquired from this API are removed from the Agora RTM server. You cannot get the same event twice.

> - The number of requests per second for each App ID must not exceed 10.
> - The RTM backend stores a maximum of 2,000 events. If the number of events exceeds 2,000, the latest event replaces the oldest event.
> - The backend returns a maximum of 1,000 events each time.
> - Agora does not guarantee the time sequence of events across geographical regions (countries or continents), because Agora stores events by geographical regions.
> - If you have pulled events from one geographical region, you may get the same events when you pull from a different geographical region. This is because Agora only synchronize events within a geographical region and does not synchronize events across geographical regions.
