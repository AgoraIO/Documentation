# Send and Receive Image or File Messages
## Introduction

You can use the Agora RTM SDK to send and receive image or file messages. 

The Agora RTM SDK supports sending non-empty images and files that do not exceed 30 MB in size. Each image or file you upload to the Agora server stays for 7 days and has a corresponding media ID. You can download the image or file from the Agora server with the media ID. 

The following diagram shows how the file or image is sent and received:

You can use the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` interface to perform the following image operations:

- Set the filename and thumbnail of the uploaded image.
- Get the size of the uploaded image.
- Get the SDK-calculated width and height of images in JPEG, JPG, BMP, and PNG format.
- Set the width and height of images. The width or height you set overwrites SDK-calculated width or height.

You can use the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` interface to perform the following file operations:

- Set the name and thumbnail of the uploaded file.
- Get the size of the uploaded file.

## Implementation

The Agora RTM SDK adds the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` interface and the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` interface to save and transfer media ID. Because the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` interface and the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` interface inherit from the `AgoraRtmMessage` interface, you can use existing peer-to-peer or channel messaging to transfer the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance and the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance. Thus, you can send and receive image or file messages.

### Send and receive image messages

<div class="alert note">Before you start, ensure that you have integrated the latest SDK into your project. You must also enable peer-to-peer and channel messages.</div>

The following steps show the general process of sending and receiving an image message:

1. Upload an image to the Agora server. When the image is successfully uploaded, the SDK returns an `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance by callback.

   Sample code for uploading an image to the Agora server:

   ```objectivec
    [AgoraRtm.kit createImageMessageByUploading:imagePath withRequest:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmImageMessage *message, AgoraRtmUploadMediaErrorCode errorCode) {
        //deal with message
    }];
   ```

    If you have a corresponding media ID for an image that is still on the Agora server, you can create an `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance with the following code:

   ```objectiveC
   [AgoraRtm.kit createImageMessageByMediaId:mediaId];
   ```

2. (Optional) Set the width, height, or thumbnail of the image by the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance.

    Sample code for setting the width and height of the image:

   ```objectivec
   [message setWidth:imageWidth];
   [message setHeight:imageHeight];
   ```

    Sample code for setting the thumbnail of the image:

   ```objectivec
   message.thumbnailWidth = thumbnailImage.size.width;
   message.thumbnailHeight = thumbnailImage.size.height;
   ```
  
3. Send the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance via peer-to-peer or channel messaging to a user or channel. The `AgoraRtmImageMessage` class interface inherits from the `AgoraRtmMessage` class interface, so you can use peer-to-peer or channel messaging to send the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance.

   Sample code for sending a peer-to-peer image message:

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit sendMessage:rtmMessage toPeer:self.mode.name sendMessageOptions:option completion:^(AgoraRtmSendPeerMessageErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

   Sample code for sending a channel image message:

   ```objectivec
   [self.rtmChannel sendMessage:rtmMessage completion:^(AgoraRtmSendChannelMessageErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

4. The user who receives the image message can receive the corresponding callback. You can get the media ID from the `AgoraRtmImageMessage` instance and save the image by media ID.

    Sample code for receiving a peer-to-peer image message:

   ```objectivec
   - (void)rtmKit:(AgoraRtmKit *)kit imageMessageReceived:(AgoraRtmImageMessage *)message fromPeer:(NSString *)peerId {
    //deal with message
    }
   ```

   Sample code for receiving a channel image message:

   ```objectivec
   - (void)channel:(AgoraRtmChannel *)channel imageMessageReceived:(AgoraRtmImageMessage *)message fromMember:(AgoraRtmMember *)member {
    //deal with message
    }
   ```
   
   Typically, you can download an image to local storage via media ID.

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit downloadMedia:message.mediaId toFile:filePath withRequest:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmDownloadMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

   For scenarios that require quick save operations, you can download the image to memory:

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit downloadMediaToMemory:message.mediaId withRequest:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, NSData *data, AgoraRtmDownloadMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

   If you need to cancel uploading or downloading an image, refer to the following example code:

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit cancelMediaUpload:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmCancelMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit cancelMediaDownload:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmCancelMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```


### Send and receive file messages

<div class="alert note">Before you start, ensure that you have integrated the latest SDK into your project. You must also enable peer-to-peer and channel messages.</div>

The following steps show the general process of sending and receiving a file message:

1. Upload a file to the Agora server. When the file is successfully uploaded, the SDK returns an `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance by callback.
   
   Sample code for uploading a file to the Agora server:

   ```objectivec
    [AgoraRtm.kit createFileMessageByUploading:filePath withRequest:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmFileMessage *message, AgoraRtmUploadMediaErrorCode errorCode) {
        //deal with message
    }];
   ```

    If you have a corresponding media ID for a file that is still on the Agora server, you can create an `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance with the following code:

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit createFileMessageByMediaId:mediaId];
   ```

2. (Optional) Set the thumbnail of the file by the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance.

   ```objectivec
   UIImage *thumbnailImage = [weakSelf generateThumbnail:imagePath toByte:5 * 1024];
   if(thumbnailImage != nil) {
   message.thumbnail = imageData;
   }
   ```

3. Send the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance via peer-to-peer or channel messaging to a user or channel. The `AgoraRtmFileMessage` class interface inherits from the `AgoraRtmMessage` class interface, so you can use peer-to-peer or channel messaging to send the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance.

   Sample code for sending a peer-to-peer file message:

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit sendMessage:rtmMessage toPeer:self.mode.name sendMessageOptions:option completion:^(AgoraRtmSendPeerMessageErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

   Sample code for sending a channel file message:

   ```objectivec
   [self.rtmChannel sendMessage:rtmMessage completion:^(AgoraRtmSendChannelMessageErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

4. The user who receives the file message can receive the corresponding callback. You can get the media ID from the `AgoraRtmFileMessage` instance and save the file by media ID.

   Sample code for receiving a peer-to-peer file message:

   ```objectivec
   - (void)rtmKit:(AgoraRtmKit *)kit fileMessageReceived:(AgoraRtmFileMessage *)message fromPeer:(NSString *)peerId {
    //deal with message
    }
   ```

   Sample code for receiving a channel file message:

   ```objectivec
   - (void)channel:(AgoraRtmChannel *)channel fileMessageReceived:(AgoraRtmFileMessage *)message fromMember:(AgoraRtmMember *)member {
    //deal with message
    }
   ```
   
   Typically, you can download a file to local storage via media ID.

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit downloadMedia:message.mediaId toFile:filePath withRequest:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmDownloadMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

   For scenarios that require quick save operations, you can download the file to memory:

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit downloadMediaToMemory:message.mediaId withRequest:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, NSData *data, AgoraRtmDownloadMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```

   If you need to cancel uploading or downloading a file, refer to the following example code:

   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit cancelMediaUpload:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmCancelMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```
	 
   ```objectivec
   [AgoraRtm.kit cancelMediaDownload:&requestId completion:^(long long requestId, AgoraRtmCancelMediaErrorCode errorCode) {}];
   ```


## Considerations

- You must log in to the Agora RTM system before calling the methods.
- Ensure that the total size of message content, filename, and thumbnail must not exceed 32 KB for each message instance.
- The `filePath` parameter for uploading and downloading methods can only accept strings with UTF-8 format. The path must be an absolute path.
- You can only cancel an ongoing upload or download task. The request ID is no longer valid when the corresponding task completes.
- To save the downloaded file or image to local memory, you must access the corresponding memory location when the `AgoraRtmDownloadMediaToMemoryBlock` callback completes.
- For each client, do not exceed a total of nine upload tasks and download tasks.
- You can set the width and height of the uploaded image by `AgoraRtmImageMessage`. The settings only exist as additional attributes and does not affect the uploaded image. The uploaded image is not resized or cropped.
- The SDK automatically sets width and height for images in JPEG, JPG, BMP, and PNG format. The width or height you set overwrites the SDK-calculated width or height.
