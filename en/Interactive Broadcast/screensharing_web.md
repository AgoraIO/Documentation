# Share the Screen
## Introduction

During a video call or interactive streaming, **sharing the screen** enhances the communication experience by displaying the speaker's screen on the display of other speakers or audience members in the channel.

<div class="alert note">The Agora Web SDK supports screen sharing in the following desktop browsers:<li>Chrome 58 or later</li><li>Edge 80 or later (Windows 10)</li><li>Firefox 56 or later</li></div>

You can use screen sharing in the following scenarios:

- Video conference: the speaker can share an image of a local file, web page, or presentation with other users in the channel.
- Online class: the teacher can share slides or notes with students.


<div class="alert info">Click the <a href="https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Screen-Sharing-Web/">online demo</a> to try this feature out.</div>


## Working principles

Screen sharing on the web client is enabled by creating a screen-sharing stream. To enable screen sharing, you need to set relevant properties when creating the stream. The web browser asks you to select which screens to share. The property settings are different in different browsers.

- If you publish the screen-sharing stream only, set `video` as `false`, and `screen` as `true` when creating a stream.
- If you publish both the local video stream and your screen-sharing stream, you need to create two client objects:
  - A client object for sending the local stream: Set `video` as `true` and `screen` as `false`.
  - A client object for sending the screen-sharing stream: Set `video` as false and `screen` as true.

As of v3.2.0, the Agora Web SDK supports setting the transmission optimization strategy by using `optimizationMode`. You can set `optimizationMode` according to the content of the shared screen:

- If the shared content is a movie or video clip, Agora recommends setting `optimizationMode` as `"motion"`. The SDK prioritizes smoothness.
- If the shared content is text or images, Agora recommends setting `optimizationMode` as `"detail"` or leaving it empty. The SDK prioritizes clarity.


## Implementation

This section introduces how to share the screen on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Electron.

Before you begin, ensure that you understand how to [start a video call](../../en/Interactive%20Broadcast/start_call_web.md) or [start interactive video streaming](../../en/Interactive%20Broadcast/start_live_web.md).

### <a name="chrome"></a>Screen sharing on Google Chrome

#### Screen sharing without the Google Chrome extension

To share the screen on Chrome, set `video` as `false`, and `screen` as `true` when creating a stream.

<div class="alert note">This function requires the Agora Web SDK v2.6 or later, and Chrome 72 or later. Otherwise, use the <a href="#ext">Google Chrome extension</a> to share the screen.</div>

```javascript
// Check if the browser supports screen sharing without an extension.
Number.tem = ua.match(/(Chrome(?=\/))\/?(\d+)/i);
if(parseInt(tem[2]) >= 72  && navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia ) {
 // Create the stream for screen sharing.
	screenStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
		streamID: uid,
		audio: false,
		video: false,
		screen: true,
	});
}
```

#### <a name="ext"></a>Screen sharing with the Google Chrome extension

1. Add the [Google Chrome Extension for Screen Sharing](../../en/Interactive%20Broadcast/chrome_screensharing_plugin.md) provided by Agora.

2. Set the `extensionId` property when you create a stream.

   ```javascript
   screenStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
   streamID: uid,
   audio: false,
   video: false,
   screen: true,
   //chrome extension ID
   extensionId: 'minllpmhdgpndnkomcoccfekfegnlikg'
   });
   ```

### Screen sharing on Edge

To share the screen on Edge, set `video` as `false`, and `screen` as `true` when creating a stream.

```javascript
screenStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
  streamID: uid,
  audio: false,
  video: false,
  screen: true,
});
```

### <a name = "ff"></a>Screen sharing on Firefox

Set the `mediaSource` property to specify the screen-sharing mode:

- `screen`：Shares the whole screen.
- `application`：Shares all windows of an application.
- `window`：Shares a specific window of an application.

```javascript
screenStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
  streamID: uid,
  audio: false,
  video: false,
  screen: true,
  mediaSource: 'screen' // 'screen', 'application', 'window'
});
```

> Firefox on Windows does not support the application mode.

### <a name = "electron"></a>Screen sharing on Electron

To share the screen on Electron, you need to draw the UI for your users to select which screen or window to share. For quick integration, Agora provides a default UI.

1. Call `AgoraRTC.createStream`, and set `screen` as `true` to create a screen-sharing stream.

   ```javascript
   localStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
       streamID: UID,
       audio: false,
       video: false,
       screen: true
   });
   ```

2. Call `localStream.init` to initialize the stream.

   ```javascript
   localStream.init(function(stream) {})
   ```

   The SDK provides a default UI for screen source selection, as the following figure shows:

   ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1571629977600)

To customize the UI, do the following:

1. Call `AgoraRTC.getScreenSources` to get sources of the screens to share.

   ```javascript
   AgoraRTC.getScreenSources(function(err, sources) {
   	console.log(sources)
   })
   ```

   The `sources` parameter is an array of the `source` object. A  `source` object contains the following properties of the screen source:

   ![img](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1547455349613)

   - `id`: The `sourceId`.
   - `name`: The name of the screen source.
   - `thumbnail`: The thumbnail of the screen source.

2. Based on the properties of `source`, draw the UI (by HTML and CSS) for selecting the screen source to share.

   The following figure shows the properties' corresponding elements on the UI for screen source selection:

   ![img](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1547456888707)

3. Get the `sourceId` of the source selected by the user.

4. Set `sourceId` when creating the screen-sharing stream.

   ```javascript
   localStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
       streamID: UID,
       audio: false,
       video: false,
       screen: true,
       sourceId: sourceId
   });
   localStream.init(function(stream) {})
   ```

> - The `getScreenSources` method is a wrapper of `desktopCapturer.getSources` provided by Electron. See [desktopCapturer](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/desktop-capturer).
> - Only Electron requires the `sourceId` parameter.

### <a name = "screenAudio"></a>Share audio

As of v3.0.0, the Agora Web SDK supports sharing the local audio playback when sharing a screen on Windows Chrome 74 or later. To share the audio, set the `screen` and `screenAudio` properties as `true` and the `audio` property as `false` when creating a screen-sharing stream.

```javascript
screenStream = AgoraRTC.createStream({
  streamID: uid,
  audio: false,
  video: false,
  screen: true,
  screenAudio: true
});
```

<div class="alert note">Note:
	<ul>
	<li>The <code>audio</code> and <code>screenAudio</code> properties are different：
			<ul>
				<li><code>audio</code> controls whether the stream contains the audio captured by the local audio input device.</li>
				<li><code>screenAudio</code> controls whether the stream contains the local audio playback.</li>
			</ul>
		Agora recommends setting <code>audio</code> as <code>false</code> in the screen-sharing stream. If you set both <code>audio</code> and <code>screenAudio</code>  as <code>true</code>, the stream contains the local audio playback only.</li>
	<li>For the audio sharing to take effect, the user must check <b>Share audio</b> on the pop-up window when sharing a screen.</li>
	<li>Audio sharing is disabled when the user shares a single application window.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

### Sample code

The following sample code shows the complete steps to implement screen sharing. Meanwhile, we provide an open-source GitHub [sample project](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Advanced-Video/tree/master/Web/Agora-Screen-Sharing-Web-Webpack). You can [try it online](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Screen-Sharing-Web) and refer to the code in  [`rtc-client.js`](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Advanced-Video/blob/master/Web/Agora-Screen-Sharing-Web-Webpack/src/rtc-client.js) and [`index.js`](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Advanced-Video/blob/master/Web/Agora-Screen-Sharing-Web-Webpack/src/index.js).

<div class="alert note">The following code uses <code>isFirefox</code> and <code>isCompatibleChrome</code> to determine the browser type, and you need to define the functions. See the code in <a href="https://github.com/AgoraIO/Advanced-Video/blob/master/Web/Agora-Screen-Sharing-Web-Webpack/src/common.js#L29"><code>common.js</code></a> for an example.</div>

```javascript
//TODO: Fill in your App ID.
var appID = "<yourAppID>";
var channel = "screen_video";
var channelKey = null;

AgoraRTC.Logger.setLogLevel(AgoraRTC.Logger.INFO);

var screenClient = AgoraRTC.createClient({
    mode: 'rtc',
    codec: 'vp8'
});
screenClient.init(appID, function() {
    screenClient.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
        // Create the stream for screen sharing.
        const streamSpec = {
            streamID: uid,
            audio: false,
            video: false,
            screen: true
          }
          // Set relevant properties according to the browser.
          // Note that you need to implement isFirefox and isCompatibleChrome.
          if (isFirefox()) {
            streamSpec.mediaSource = 'window';
          } else if (!isCompatibleChrome()) {
            streamSpec.extensionId = 'minllpmhdgpndnkomcoccfekfegnlikg';
          }
        screenStream = AgoraRTC.createStream(streamSpec);
        // Initialize the stream.
        screenStream.init(function() {
            // Play the stream.
            screenStream.play('Screen');
            // Publish the stream.
            screenClient.publish(screenStream);

        }, function(err) {
            console.log(err);
        });

    }, function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    })
});
```

## <a name = "both"></a>Enable both screen sharing and video

One client only sends one stream. If you want to enable both screen sharing and video on one host, you need to create two clients:

- A client to send the screen-sharing stream.
- A client to send the video stream.

```javascript
// Create the client to send the screen-sharing stream.
var screenClient = AgoraRTC.createClient({mode: 'rtc', codec: 'vp8'});
screenClient.init(key, function() {
 screenClient.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
  // Create the screen-sharing stream, screenStream.
  ...
  screenClient.publish(screenStream);
 }
  }

// Create the client to send the video stream.
var videoClient = AgoraRTC.createClient({mode: 'rtc', codec: 'vp8'});
videoClient.init(key, function() {
videoClient.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
  // Create the video stream, videoStream.
  ...
  videoClient.publish(videoStream);
 }
}
```

If two clients of a host subscribe to each other, extra charges incur.

<img alt="../_images/screensharing_streams.png" src="https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/en/screensharing_streams.png" style="width: 500px; "/>

Agora recommends that you save the returned `uid` when each client joins the channel and handle the subscription as follows:
- For the video client, when the `stream-added` event occurs, first check if the joined `uid` belongs to a local stream. If yes, do not subscribe to the stream.
- For the screen-sharing client, do not subscribe to any stream.

```javascript
var localStreams = [];
...

screenClient.join(channelKey, channel, null, function(uid) {
 // Save the uid of the local stream.
 localStreams.push(uid);
}
...

videoClient.on('stream-added', function(evt) {
 var stream = evt.stream;
 var uid = stream.getId()
 // When the 'stream-added' event occurs, check if the stream is a local uid.
 if(!localStreams.includes(uid)) {
  console.log('subscribe stream: ' + uid);
  // Subscribe to the stream.
  videoClient.subscribe(stream);
 }
})
```


## Set the screen profile

The default video profile for screen sharing is a resolution of 1920 × 1080 (width × height) and a frame rate of 5 fps. To use a different profile, call `Stream.setScreenProfile` to set the screen profile, as in the following example:

```javascript
// After creating a stream for screen sharing
screenStream.setScreenProfile("720p_1");
```

The SDK supports the following screen profiles:

| Screen profile | Resolution (width × height) | Frame rate |
| :------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------- |
| `480p_1`       | 640 × 480                   | 5 fps      |
| `480p_2`       | 640 × 480                   | 30 fps     |
| `720p_1`       | 1280 × 720                  | 5 fps      |
| `720p_2`       | 1280 × 720                  | 30 fps     |
| `1080p_1`      | 1920 × 1080                 | 5 fps      |
| `1080p_2`      | 1920 × 1080                 | 30 fps     |

<div class="alert note">Note:<br/>
<li> Ensure that you set the screen profile before initializing (<code>Stream.init</code>) the screen-sharing stream.</li>
<li>Setting the screen profile may affect your billing. Due to limitations of some devices and browsers, the resolution you set may fail to take effect and is adjusted by the browser. In this scenario, billing is calculated based on the actual resolution.</li></div>


## Considerations

- Set the `video` property as `false` when creating the screen-sharing stream.
- If you need to create multiple streams, we recommend setting the `audio` property as `true` for only one local stream.
- Do not set the UID of the screen-sharing stream to a fixed value. Streams with the same UID can interfere with each other.
- **Do not subscribe to a locally published screen-sharing stream**, else additional charges incur.
- Sharing the window of a QQ chat on Windows causes a black screen.

## Reference

When implementing the screen sharing, you can also refer to the following articles:
