# Agora Cloud Recording Overview
Agora Cloud Recording is a component provided by Agora to record and save voice calls, video calls, and interactive streaming on your cloud storage. It is compatible with the Agora Native SDK v1.7.0+ and the Agora Web SDK v1.12.0+. 

You can quickly and flexibly record one-to-one or one-to-many audio and video calls or live interactive streaming through simple integration. Compared with Agora On-premise Recording, Agora Cloud Recording is more efficient and convenient as it does not require deploying Linux servers.

With Agora Cloud Recording, you can record calls or live streaming for your users to watch at their convenience. For example, a user can either attend an online course at the time of the course or watch the recorded course later, made possible by the Agora Cloud Recording service.
